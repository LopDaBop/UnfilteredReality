        <h2>About the Podcast</h2>
        <p>I'm your host, and in this show, I take a close look at interesting topics and realities most of us don't question. I do the research, break it down, and bring you clear, informative episodes that make it easy to understand what's really going on.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Question Everything?</h2>
        <p>The truth is, we often get so caught up in social norms that we don't stop to ask if what we consider "normal" is actually safe or beneficial in any way. These common assumptions can create a false sense of trust, making people less likely to think for themselves and more willing to accept things as they are.</p>
        
        <div class="reality">
          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>My goal for this podcast is simple: I want to find overlooked topics, investigate them thoroughly, and present the information in a clear, accessible way. By the end of each episode, you'll have gained valuable knowledge and awareness about important issues that often go unquestioned.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>Each episode of <strong>Unfiltered Reality</strong> runs about 10-15 minutes ‚Äì just enough time to dive deep into a topic without overwhelming you. You can expect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear, well-researched information</li>
          <li>Real-world examples that bring concepts to life</li>
          <li>Surprising insights you won't hear elsewhere</li>
          <li>Practical takeaways you can apply immediately</li>
        </ul>
